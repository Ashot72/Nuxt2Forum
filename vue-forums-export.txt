The articles would help you understand how the rank works\n\nBest Regsrds,\n\nAshot Abrahamyan",

      "content" : "Hi Ashot,\n\nThank you for response.\n\nActually the issue that we have is as follows\n\nWe have a publishing page with the Title of the page as \"WeeklyReoprt\" for both English and Swedish languages. When we search for the word \"WeeklyReport\" with English as my default language, the exact page is displayed as the first ranked result (Since the title matches exactly).\n\nWith Swedish as my default language, if I search for the text \"WeeklyReport\", the same page with exactly matching title is displayed as the 8th or 9th ranked result. Our doubt is that if the same word matches the title exactly, why the results ranks have changed in Swedish language.\n\nNo Ranking model is selected in our case but the ranking of an exactly matching text changes with language and users find it difficult.\n\nWe would like to have the same matching search result at least to be shown at the top.\n\nKindly suggest..\n\nRegards,\nRobert\n\n",
